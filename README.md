Connect Four is a two-player board game (built with vanilla JavaScript) in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, Four in a Line, Drop Four, and Gravitrips (in Russia).

RULES:

You will start as Player One

You will not be allowed to go in squares that are not at the bottom of the grid, or do not have an occupied square under it

Once your go is taken and you did not win, It will be player Two's go

The gamer will continue until a winning combination of four is reached by player One or player Two, or until the grid is full and no winning combination was found.
